Welcome to the *templates* repository.

As the name suggests, this is where various templates of mine will be stored.\
The templates are made using the typesetting language called [Typst]([url](https://typst.app/docs/)).

Templates definition are stored in the **lib** folder.\
Examples using the templates are stored in the **examples** folder.\
Resources required by examples are stored in the **resources** folder.
